‚úîOur ultimate goal is to low-level register manipulations are specific to the ESP8266/ESP32 platform.

ü§îWhy do we need this? or If someone asks me why did you do this here is the answer --> Normally, in an easier-to-use language like Arduino C++, you can just call digitalWrite() to control pins, but this is slower and less efficient for low-level control. 

By using registers, you can: 

    1.)Directly control the hardware (no middleman like a function).
  
    2.)Make things happen faster because you're working at the hardware level.
  
    3.)Access special features (like timers, interrupts, or custom settings) that aren't available in high-level code.
  
    4.)Using registers like this gives you complete control over how the microcontroller operates and interacts with hardware like LEDs, motors, sensors, etc.

‚úîThe following diagram depicts the pin out diagram for NodeMCU ESP8266.

‚úîWe first start our programming by referrring to the Technical Reference Manual(TRM) from ESP.(https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp8266-technical_reference_en.pdf).

## Project 1 : Servo Motor control - Register level access 

‚®è The primary aim of the embedded system controller to be used is make a servo system that is controlled based on expectation from a customer. 
We are imagining the context in terms of a small project driven by the a person to achieve high level requirments and we flow down here with implementation using there sample projects.

‚®è So, basically let us take the requirment given with the following statement. _"The system shall be able to run servo motor clocked at 80 Hz from 0 deg to 90 deg within 20 ms with delay of +/- 290 ns".

‚®è The ask is with a partiular sigma devaition delay of the servo motor. If we use a register level programming with a minimum delay in the 125 ns. Where as the time taken to abstract the function from a high level function is very high(~4.5 micro second).
